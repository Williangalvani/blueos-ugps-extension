### UGPS Extension

This extension **has not been validated**, and currently **has no UI page** (so creates no listing in the sidebar).

Configuration is done via the extension's "Settings" dropdown in the "Installed" tab of the Extensions Manager.

If necessary, change the IPs to relevant alternatives:
```
    "UGPS_IP=192.168.2.94",
    "TOPSIDE_IP=192.168.2.1"
```

Use the "View Logs" button to check the status.
